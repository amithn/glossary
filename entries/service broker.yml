The Service Broker API defines an HTTP interface between the services marketplace of a platform and service brokers.

The service broker is the component of the service that implements the Service Broker API, for which a platform's marketplace is a client. Service brokers are responsible for advertising a catalog of service offerings and service plans to the marketplace, and acting on requests from the marketplace for provisioning, binding, unbinding, and deprovisioning.

In general, provisioning reserves a resource on a service; we call this reserved resource a service instance. What a service instance represents can vary by service. Examples include a single database on a multi-tenant server, a dedicated cluster, or an account on a web application.
